Using the data within the set, I plan to try to predict whether a technology based reddit post would be informative vs entertainment using the language used in the title of the post, any text in the body of the post, and the language used in the comments of the post. This is a text classification problem because I will be using word usage and frequency to determine a binary label between \"informative\" and \"entertaining\" posts. The dataset to be used is linked below.\n\n* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedkhaledelsafty/top-10-tech-subreddits?select=combined_subreddits.csv\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n_You will now load the dataset and carry out some exploratory data analysis steps to better understand what text data looks like.
